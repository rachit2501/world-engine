# Meet the World Engine

![World Engine Cover](/og.jpg)

World Engine (WE) is the most powerful framework for building GameChains — your own dedicated layer 2 blockchain —
built by game developers, for game developers.

The World Engine stack comes batteries-included with a suite of tools that makes it easier than ever to spin up
your own GameChain, deploy horizontally-scalable blockchain games, and access superpowers previously available only
to teams with a dedicated blockchain engineering team.

## The future of onchain games, now on World Engine

- **Horizontally-scalable, real-time, fully onchain game** — Build complex onchain games with real-time
gameplay without the limitations of existing blockchains. World Engine's Cardinal game shard provide developers with
a high-performance onchain game backend that integrates seamlessly with your game engine of
choice (Unity, Unreal, Godot, etc). Onchain powers, offchain performance. You don't have to choose.
- **Gamified blockchain experience** — Write the rules to your own world. You can make your game
assets/NFTs more valuable by giving them superpowers on your chain. Maybe a mythical artifact that gives you
permission to deploy a smart contract on your chain? Perhaps you want to make smart contract destroyable in-game?
The possibilities are endless.
- **Integrated UGC platform for your games and IPs** — Let players expand your game universe
and economy through smart contracts. The World Engine EVM Base Shard allow both developers and players alike to deploy
smart contracts that interoperates with the game, opening up a treasure trove of emergent behavior, such as
player-run guild system, prediction market, and more.
